# INFO6210_DataManagement-DatabaseDesign

**Database Purpose**

With the massive amount of COVID-19 patients occupying hospital beds, the purpose of the database is
to collect health information of inpatients, improve prognosis, modify treatment strategies, and adjust
admission standards in order to manage COVID-19 patients more efficiently. This database will be used
by both physicians and hospital administrative staff.

**Business Problems Addressed**
- Provide patients’ information to physicians to give appropriate treatments and further reduce the
COVID-19 death rate.
- Allow medical care providers to record and compare different treatment results, which helps to
further improve treatment strategies.
- Ensure that physicians can identify the severity of the disease through clinical symptoms and
examinations and further adjust admission standards to better control the number of COVID-19
inpatients.
- Allow administrative staff to collect patients’ treatment-related information and generate descriptive
patient reports.
- Ensure that administrative staff are able to find available beds immediately for COVID-19 patients.
- Supply information to improve the scheduling of admission and discharge, and to allocate scarce
medical resources more fairly for COVID-19.
- Permit administrative staff to track the geographical distribution of COVID-19 patients to prevent
the spread.
